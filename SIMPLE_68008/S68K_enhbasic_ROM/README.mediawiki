== Enhanced BASIC integrated with S68K_002 ROM Monitor ==

* Lee Davison's Enhanced Basic for 68000
** Ported by Jeff Tranter for his TS2 single board computer
* Runs on SIMPLE-68008 card
* This build is specifically made to be combined with [https://github.com/douggilliland/Linux-68k/tree/master/SIMPLE_68008/S68K_002 S68K_002 Monitor ROM] and programmed into a 32KB or larger PROM

== Build ==

* [https://github.com/douggilliland/Linux-68k/blob/master/SIMPLE_68008/README.wiki 68K Code Build Environment]
* Assembled using the [https://github.com/douggilliland/Linux-68k/tree/master/vasm VASM retargetable assembler]
* First, build the [https://github.com/douggilliland/Linux-68k/tree/master/SIMPLE_68008/S68K_002 S68K_002 Monitor ROM]
* Run make for the Enhanced BASIC which pulls in the S68K_002 code
** Result is a .hex file
* Program using PROM programmer

== Memory Map ==

* EPROM base address = 0x80000
** 0x80000-0x83FFF - First 16KB reserved addresses for monitor (plenty of room for expansion)
*** Code is from 0x80400-0x80caf (Less than 4KB)
** 0x84000-0x87FFF - Second 16KB reserves addresses for BASIC (plenty of room for expansion)
*** Code is from 0x84800-0x87D1F (Less than 16KB)

== Running ==

* Boots into the monitor
* Run BASIC with 'B' on command line
* Runs at 38,400 baud

== EhBASIC68 ==

* Enhanced BASIC is a BASIC interpreter for the 68k family microprocessors
* It is constructed to be quick and powerful and easily ported between 68k systems
* It requires few resources to run and includes instructions to facilitate easy low level handling of hardware devices. It also retains most of the powerful high level instructions from similar BASICs.
