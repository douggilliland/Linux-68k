= Sample Game =

* Demonstrates semi-random numbers uring 68681 Timer to put random characters on the ANSI screen at random locations

== ANSI driver ==
* [https://github.com/douggilliland/Linux-68k/blob/master/SIMPLE_68008/S68K_clibs/S68K_nncurses.h nncurses]
** Similar to ncurses
* Double buffered
** Write to fromBuffer[][]
** Copy to screenBuffer[][]
** Send out deltas as ANSI sequences to the Serial Terminal

== Build ==

* [https://github.com/douggilliland/Linux-68k/blob/master/SIMPLE_68008/README.wiki 68K Code Build Environment]
* Build the code using the provided make file
** It gets linked at address $2000
* To load it into the S68K_002 monitor you can run the command "L" and then send the run (S record) file to the serial port
* Run the program from the S68K_002 monitor using R2000
** Output should look like the following:
