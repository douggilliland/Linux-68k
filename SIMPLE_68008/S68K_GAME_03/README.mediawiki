* Move an object around the screen using arrow keys
* ANSI driver [https://github.com/douggilliland/Linux-68k/blob/master/SIMPLE_68008/S68K_clibs/S68K_nncurses.h nncurses]
** Similar to ncurses

== Build ==

* You will need a version of gcc built as a cross-compiler for the 68k platform
** I used gcc version 7.5.0
* Build the code using the provided make file
** It gets linked at address $2000
* To load it into the S68K_002 monitor you can run the command "L" and then send the run (S record) file to the serial port
* Run the program from the S68K_002 monitor using R2000
** Output should look like the following:
