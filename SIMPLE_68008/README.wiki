== Environment ==

* Code built on Oracle VM VirtualBox
** Host machine is a Windows box
** Running MINT Linux OS

=== Tool and Toolchains ===

* Some of the code is built using the m68K cross-compiled toolchain
** Used to create C code and most of the assembly code
** Weirder assembly language syntax
* Some of the code is built using the VASM cross-compiled tool
** Assembly code only
** More normal assembly language syntax

== Fix error from no longer being allowed to use ID/Pwd ==

* GitHub eliminated the ability to log in with user ID and password
* The solution is to switch to SSH to log into GitHub
* Needed to make a new key
<pre>
ssh-keygen
</pre>
* Copy id_rsa.pub file contents to github public key via github web browser

== Connect to database with ssh instead of https ==

<pre>
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin douggilliland/Linux-68k.git
</pre>

== Push the code changes up to github ==

<pre>
git add .
git commit -m 'my commit'
git push
(or if needed)
git push --set-upstream origin master
</pre>
