* Runs on SIMPLE-68008 card

* Assembled using the VASM retargetable assembler
* THis version is loaded into SRAM from the S68K_002 monitor
* In theory, can be built to run from EPROM

== EhBASIC68 ==

* Enhanced BASIC is a BASIC interpreter for the 68k family microprocessors
* It is constructed to be quick and powerful and easily ported between 68k systems
* It requires few resources to run and includes instructions to facilitate easy low level handling of hardware devices. It also retains most of the powerful high level instructions from similar BASICs.
