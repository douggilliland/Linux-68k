= Interrupt Test Code for SIMPLE-68008 =

* Test timer/counter interrupt from DUART
** Makes a 60 Hz Counter in memory
* Runs from RAM
* Downloaded as S Records
** Loaded with L command in [https://github.com/douggilliland/Linux-68k/tree/S-Record-Load-working/S68K_002 S68K_002 monitor]
* R1000 to run setup
* Use timer function in DUART
* 3.6864 MHz / 16 = 23400
* 23,400 / 60 (Hz) / 2 per cycle = 1920 count = 0x780
* Increment a long in 0x604(-0x607)
* 60 Hz is 0x780 divisor
* Stop timer to clear timer
* Restart timer to set up interrupt on next timer edge
