* It runs on my TS2 FPGA Retro-Computer. 
* Jeff Tranter made one small source change and added a Makefile. 
* Build it using the VASM cross-assembler. 

It loads into RAM and the start address is $3648.

* Used vasm 68K cross assembler
* Brings up a small Forth system.
* Note that the FIG standard has been superseeded by F79, F83 and ANSI.
* What has survived is the FIG implementation model, where you start with an assembly source listing, not assuming any Forth tools available.
* A print out of this once was available from our user group and a photocopy can still be had from me.
