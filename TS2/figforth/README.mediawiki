== FIGForth ==

* Brings up a small Forth system
* Runs on [https://github.com/douggilliland/Retro-Computers/tree/master/68000/TS2_FPGA TS2_FPGA Retro-Computer]
* It loads into RAM from TUTOR
* Start address is '''$3648'''

== Build ==

* Build it using the VASM cross-assembler
* Used vasm 68K cross assembler

== History ==

* Jeff Tranter made one small source change and added a Makefile
* Note that the FIG standard has been superseeded by F79, F83 and ANSI
* What has survived is the FIG implementation model, where you start with an assembly source listing, not assuming any Forth tools available
* A print out of this once was available from our user group and a photocopy can still be had from me
* Modifications Doug Gilliland 2022
