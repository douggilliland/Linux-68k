/ ac-mq-blinker.pal - Rapidly modify AC and MQ
/
/ This program twiddles AC and MQ rapidly, with a small amount of delay
/ between each update so the lights aren't just a solid blur.
/
/ While this program runs at full speed, only AC and MQ appear to a
/ human to really change.  PC also changes, of course, but since the
/ program spends so much of its time in the delay loop at the top, it
/ appears to be stuck at PC=1.
/
/ It also modifies MB rapidly, but the pattern we use means it looks
/ like the lamps aren't changing, but are all on, dimmed by varying
/ amounts.
