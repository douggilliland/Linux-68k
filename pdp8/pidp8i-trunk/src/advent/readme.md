# PDP-8 ADVENTURE

This is a copy of the [latest upstream release][up], v2.4.  Prior
releases are [curated separately][alive] as part of [Bill Catteyâ€™s PDP-8
Alive project](https://poetnerd.com/pdp8-alive/).

This version of Adventure was orginally written by Rick Murphy when he
worked at Digital back in 1979 and published as DECUS 8-889. (Back then
he went by Dick, instead of Rick.)

Instructions on running ADVENT under the FORTRAN IV Runtime System,
`FRTS`, can be found in the text file [`ADVENT.DC`][doc].

*Abstract*: Adventure is a magical, unpredictable and often addicting
computer game that has caught on in the United States in near epidemic
proportions.

It is a treasure hunt with all the trimmings - mysteries and challenges
that grow more and more complex as the game unravels. Adventure is
more of a puzzle than a game. Once solved, it's mastered. The mastering,
however, often takes months of drawing maps and planning strategy.

Adventure's sweeping popularity lies in it's power to enchant. Players
are projected into a world of fantasy, one that blends the heart pounding
suspense of "Treasure Island" with the magic of "Alice in Wonderland".

*Note*: This is a version of the popular PDP-11 Adventure game (DECUS
No. 11-340), containing all the features, but modified to run on a PDP-8.
