# OS/8 Combined (Unified) Kit

This subtree builds the OS/8 Combined Kit from source into a variety
of distribution media images.

It is signifcant because it is the latest, greatest, official distribution of OS/8.

The kit is described in Software Product Description (S.P.D. 4.4.5)
which can be found starting at page 21 of the October-November 1980
PDP-8 Digital Software News AA-K629A-BA.

The SPD defines the minimum hardware requirement as: PDP-8/a, /e, or /m
with 12K words of memory or DECStation 88/80, /90, /92, or /97, with
RK8J or RL8A disk. That said, we believe this system will run on a
single TD8E DECtape system, it should run fine on PDP-8/I hardware, and
with a little fiddling with old device drivers, it should support an
RF08 disk.

The OS/8 Combined Kit Information Guide (order number AA-J016B-TA)
describes the kit in an overview section as follows:

    As the name implies, the kit is a combination of OS/8 software
    products. It includes the software and documentation contained in
    the following kits:

      o  OS/8, Version 3D, Operating System (described in Software
         Product Description (S.P.D. 4.1.11)

      o  OS/8, Version 3D, Extension (S.P.D. 4.5.8)

      o  OS/8, Version 3D, Device Extensions for RL01, RX02, and KT8A
         (S.P.D. 4.12.0)

      o  OS/8, Version 3D, FORTRAN IV (S.P.D. 4.10.7)

    In addition, the kit's modules have been updated with the binary
    patches described in the OS/8 Device Extensions User's Guide and in
    the issues of the Digital Software News (through June 1979).
