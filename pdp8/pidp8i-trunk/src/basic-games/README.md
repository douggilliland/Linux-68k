# BASIC Games and Demos

When this package is installed, the files are found on the `DSK:` partition of the
bootable image.

Many of them were ported to OS/8 BASIC by DEC employee Kay R. Fisher.
Most were published in the DEC publication, *101 BASIC Computer
Games*. That book describes itself as follows:

>It is the first collection of games all in BASIC. It is also the only
collection that contains both a complete listing and a sample run of
each game along with a descriptive write-up.

The first printing was in 1973. Apparently the original version of
the programs were in PDP-11 RSTS BASIC, so porting to the OS/8 BASIC
dialect would often be needed.  A quite readable preserved version of
the 1975 edition can be [found online][book].  If a demo is from this
book, it is designated `-101-` instead of `-----` below. The book
provides a page or two of useful lore, and a sample run.

This file provides usage, history, and ongoing curation information about
the items in this package.  (An HTML table is used instead of a markdown table
to take greater control of the display of the information.)

<tr><td><tt>ROCKET.BA</td></td><td>-101-</td><td>Lunar lander simulation. Written by Jim Storer, Lexington High School. Ported from Focal by David Ahl, Digital. Lost for a while due to bad disk bits.
Using a partial copy from <a href="http://www.pdp8online.com/pdp8cgi/os8_html/ROCKET.BA?act=file;fn=images/os8/diag-games-kermit.rk05;blk=561,9,1;to=ascii">Dave Gesswein's Archive</a>, a RSTS-11 version
was found at <a href="http://pdp-11.trailing-edge.com/rsts11/rsts-11-013/ROCKET.BAS">pdp-11.trailing-edge.com</a> and re-ported to OS/8 by Bill Cattey, 
converting RSTS BASIC constructs to OS/8 constructs, and eliminating ON ERROR GOTO that does
not exist in OS/8. This code diverged significantly from the version appearing in <i>101 BASIC Computer Games</i>, but is functionally equivalent.

<tr><td><tt>ROCKT1.BA</td></td><td>-101-</td><td>Another Lunar Lander Simulator. Written by Eric Peters, Digital. Thought lost.

<tr><td><tt>WAR.BA</td></td><td>-101-</td><td>Play the game of war against the computer. Was thought lost.  Recovered from [Dave Gesswein's Archive](). However, that port to OS/8
BASIC contained a bug and could never run.  Line 230 defines the array for the cards.
In OS/8 BASIC the maximum string size needed to be specified, as well as the number of strings.
`230 DIM A$(52,3),L(54)` will not accomodate the 10-value card.  The 3 needed to be a 4. 
Program fixed and run-tested.</td></tr>
