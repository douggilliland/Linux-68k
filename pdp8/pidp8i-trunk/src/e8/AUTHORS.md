E8 was created by Bill Silver <bsilver@tidewater.net>.  The first
version was [posted to the PiDP-8/I mailing list][op] on 2020.04.05; it
is tagged “v0” in the Fossil repository. The subsequent 8 versions were
also posted to the mailing list and are tagged with their version
numbers and posting timestamps.

Warren Young <wyoung@tangentsoft.com> converted these zip files to [a
Fossil repository][repo] and converted the PDF user manual to Markdown
format on 2020.04.25, making some improvements to the manual along the
way.

From v9 onward, development happened on the Fossil repository.
