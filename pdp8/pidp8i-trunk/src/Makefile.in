# Makefile.in - Processed by autosetup's configure script to generate
#    an intermediate GNU make(1) file for building the PiDP-8/I software
#    from within its src/ subdirectory.
#
# The resulting Makefile will redirect simple "make" calls to the top
# level as well as the major top-level targets (e.g. "make clean") but
# purposefully will not redirect anything like an installation or "run
# the system" type target.  Its only purpose is to help out those who
# are working on the PiDP-8/I project's C source code from within this
# directory.  If you need to work on the wider system, do it from the
# project's top level.
#
# If you are seeing this at the top of a file called Makefile and you
# intend to make edits, do that in Makefile.in.  Saying "make" will then
# re-build Makefile from that modified Makefile.in before proceeding to
# do the "make" operation.
