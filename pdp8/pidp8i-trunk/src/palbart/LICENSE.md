---------

This is free software.  There is no fee for using it.  You may make any
changes that you wish and also give it away.  If you can make commercial
product out of it, fine, but do not put any limits on the purchaser's
right to do the same.  If you improve it or fix any bugs, it would be
nice if you told me and offered me a copy of the new version.
