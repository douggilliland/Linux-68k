/* 
 * Program to convert between POSIX ASCII text files
 * and the output of OS/8 PIP to the Paper Tape Punch.

 * The OS/8 paper tape punch format is:
 *
 *     leader: a bunch of ASCII NUL chars to be ignored.
 *     ASCII with the 8th bit set, CR+LF line endings.
 *     trailer: a bunch of ASCII NUL chars to be ignored.

 * This program can be used as a filter from stdin to stdout or
 * it will create a new file with name ending in .txt if going to
 * POSIX text or .ptp if going to OS/8 PIP Paper Tape format.

 * If the program is called with the name "txt2ptp" then
 * LTCOUNT (default 100) bytes of leader is prepended to the
 * output file and LTCOUNT bytes of leader are appended.
 * The 8th bit of every output character is set, and LF-only
 * input is turned into CR+LF output.  CR+LF input is passed
 * as-is.
 
 * If called by any other name, the ASCII NUL character is
 * ignored anywhere in the file, and the 8th bit is cleared.
 * Line endings are untouched in this case.

 * This program helps work around the issue that the 
 * OS/8 Paper Tape reader handler assumes the last
 * character in the buffer is junk, so that when you send
 * a plain text file into PDP-8 SIMH OS/8 with the
 * ptr device, the last character is lost.
