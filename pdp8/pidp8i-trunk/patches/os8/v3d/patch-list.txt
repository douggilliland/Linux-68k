# FRTS-51.3.3-O is to enable FRTS to work with 2-page system
# handlers.  I've read the code but do not fully understand it.
# It is plausable that it generalizes on the code that makes
# the 2-page TD8E handler work.  But it could also be a
# patch tha tONLY works with the OS/8 Devices Extension kit QF026.
# We are enabling the patch for not.  If further testing shows
# that it breaks TD8E support, we will turn it off.

# when the user does not pass --disable-os8-macrel to configure.
