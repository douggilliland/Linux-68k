# FORTRAN COMPILER FAILS TO RECOGNIZE " AS AN ERROR (SPR 8-2428 JB)
# Problem:  The F4 compiler fails to recognize the double quotes (") as
# an incorrect character in a subroutine call argument.
# Instead, it generates an argueless call.
# Solution:  The following patch corrects this problem and should be
# installed:
.GET SYS F4
.ODT
3343/ 7440 7640
1130/ 6402  6403
\c
.SAVE SYS F4
# This patch corrects this problem and upgrades the F4.SV to V4C.
