# MSBAT V3A  SEQ. 31.22.1 M
# DIM STATEMENT NOT WORKING IN MSBAT (SR)
# PROBLEM:
# MSBAT V3A is converting a 'DIM' punch in a mark sense
# card into a dimension statement.  This statement is not
# recognized by BASIC.
# DIAGNOSOS:
# The punch should be translated to 'DIM', not
# 'DIMENSION'.
# SOLUTION:
# Apply the following patch:
.GET SYS:MSBAT
.ODT
4015/1505 1500
3671/6301 6302
\c
.SAVE SYS:MSBAT
# This patch upgrades MSBAT to V3B.
