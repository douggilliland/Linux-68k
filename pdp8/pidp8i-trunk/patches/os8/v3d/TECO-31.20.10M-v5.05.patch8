# TECO computes the product n*0 incorrectly.
# Complementing a 13-bit 0 sets the link.
# TECO fails to account for this.
# The following patch to TECO V5.04 fixes this bug by
# zeroing the link before starting the multiply.
# This patch upgrades TECO to V5.05
# Just as in V3C TECO (Version 4), multiplication by
# negative numbers is not supported and unpredictable
# results will occur if a multiplicand is less than 0
