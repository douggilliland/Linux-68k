# PROBLEM WITH AY COMMAND (SR)
# 
# Problem: On rare occasions, the Y command will fail, giving the error message
# 
#     ?NAY Numeric Argument with Y
# 
# even though no numeric argument was specified.
# For example, the AY command (Append then Yank) consistently fails in this manner.
# The test for a numeric argument is incorrect.
# The following patch corrects this problem and upgrades TECO to 5A:

.GET SYS TECO
