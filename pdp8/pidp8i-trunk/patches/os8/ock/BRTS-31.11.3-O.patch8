# LINE SIZE ON OUTPUT OF BASIC (JR.)
# There seems to be great interest in extending basic output to 133
# characters. The following patch will extend the output line width to
# 132 chars (9 columns of number data). Basic console input will remain
# at 72 chars max - that is not easily patched since the buffer ? other
# code + data.  This restriction does not apply to file I/O - only the
# tty.
