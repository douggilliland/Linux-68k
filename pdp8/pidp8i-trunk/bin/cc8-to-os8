# cc8-to-os8 - Filter C code meant for the CC8 cross-compiler so that it
#   will work with the OS/8 version of CC8.
#
#   This is not meant to fix up 100% of the differences in the C
#   compilers, just the ones which prevent src/cc8/examples/*.c
#   from building under OS/8 CC8 as-is.
#
#   You can run it like a filter: 
#
#       $ cc8-to-os8 < foo.c | txt2ptp > foo.pt
#
#   Or you can just give it one or more file name(s), with output going
#   to stdout, which gives this way to hack around the lack of #include:
#
#       $ cc8-to-os8 myheader.h foo.c > OS8FOO.C
