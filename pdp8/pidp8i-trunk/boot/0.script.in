; This script initializes a populated OS/8 environment on an
; RK05 cartridge disk pack.  That's 2.5 whole megabytes, so big 
; the OS requires that you split it into two partitions in order
; to address the whole disk!  Thus the "RKB0:" references you
; will find in tutorials, as that refers to the second half ("B")
; of the first ("0") RK05 cartridge disk.  The default location
; the OS uses is formally called "RKA0:", alias "SYS:".
;
; See 3.script if you want to load OS/8 via DECtape instead.
;
; This file is read on simulator startup when the IF switches are
; set to 0, so it defines the default starting environment for the
; simulator.
;
; If you need to soft-restart the simulator back into OS/8 from some
; other state -- that is, you initially started the simulator with
; IF != 0 -- you can set IF = 7 and toggle the Sing_Step switch on
; and back off, which restarts the simulator with 7.script, which in
; turn loads this one.  This somewhat clumsy arrangement is required
; because toggling Sing_Step with IF = 0 must not be made to restart
; the simulator, else there would be no way to use Sing_Step for any
; of its other functions.  See the PiDP-8/I instructions for details.
