	# 
	# -   nce:  don't cuddle else
	# -   cli4: indent case statement labels 4 spaces
	# -   nlp:  don't align continued statements at the opening parenthesis
	# -   pcs:  put a space before the opening parenthesis of a function call
	# -   di1:  don't line up variable types and names in separate columns
	# -   i4:   use 4-space indents
	# -   l100: allow lines up to 100 columns before forcibly breaking them
	# -   ncs:  don't put a space between a cast and its operand
	# -   ss:   add a space before semicolon with empty loop body
	# -   nbbo: don't break long lines before || and && operators
