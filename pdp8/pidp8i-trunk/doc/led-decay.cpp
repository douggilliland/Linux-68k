// Decay function is 1 - x^2, meaning the most recent event is
// considered 100%, with older events having increasingly lesser effect
// on the overall brightness until we hit 0% consideration at the end of
// the sample set.
//
// We need to scale that so that the total area under the decay
// function's curve is 1, so that if we feed a 50% duty cycle in, we
// get 50% out, but if we skew the 1s toward the front of the sample
// set (i.e. closer to "now"), we get greater brightness than if they
// are skewed toward the past.
//
// The Pi ships with Mathematica, which answers this question with:
//
//    Solve[Integrate[z * (1 - x^2), {x, 0, 1}] == 1, z]
//
// We get z = 1.5.
//
// If you want a different decay function, it needs to substitute for
// the 1 - x^2 bit.  It needs to start at 1 and decay to 0 over the
// range [0 <= x <= 1].  Run that through Mathematica to find the
// resulting value of z that gives a total of 1 over the sample span.
