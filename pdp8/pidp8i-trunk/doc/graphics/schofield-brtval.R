# schofield-brtval.R: Generate SVG graph of the brightness curves
#    produced by Ian Schofield's ILS patch.
#
# The schofield-brtval.svg file checked into Fossil is modified from the
# version output by this program:
#
# 1. The colors are modified to match the scheme on tangentsoft.com/pidp8i
#
# 2. The data line thickness was increased
#
# 3. The data lines were smoothed by Inkscape's "simplify" function
