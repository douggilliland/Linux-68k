== ExtRAMTest ==

* Test the External SRAM on the RETRO-EP4CE1card
* The RETRO-EP4CE15 card has 1MB of External SRAM
* External SRAM only supports 8-bit accesses
* External SRAM goes from 0x300000 to 0x3FFFFF (1 MB)
* Test checks the physical connections to the SRAM
* Test does not exhaustively check the SRAM itself
* Test takes several seconds with a 25 MHz 68000 CPU
* TUTOR14 uses SRAM from 0x000000 to 0x000800
